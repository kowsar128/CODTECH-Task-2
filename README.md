Overview of the Project

project : STUDENT GRADE MANAGER
![StudentGradeManager](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/81cdced9-9ce4-49c2-a156-1797aec060be)

Objectives:

To develop a Java program that manages student grades by allowing users to input grades for various subjects.The program calculates the average grade, determines the corresponding letter grade, and computes the GPA based on the input grades.It helps users practice input handling, conditional logic, list operations, and calculations in Java.

Key Activities:

1 Grade Input:
        
  *Prompt the user to enter grades for subjects, storing them in a list.
  *Allow users to stop input and calculate results by entering 0.

2 Average Calculation:
       
  *Sum the entered grades and calculate the average.
        
3 Letter Grade Determination:
        
  *Assign a letter grade (A, B, C, etc.) based on the average grade.

4 GPA Calculation:
        
  *Convert each grade to quality points and compute the GPA.

5 Results Display:
       
  *Output a summary showing the average grade, letter grade, and GPA.

Technologies Used:

1 Programming Language:

  *Java: The core programming language used to write the program.

2 Data Structures:

  *ArrayList: Used to store the list of grades dynamically.

3 Libraries/Packages:

  *java.util.Scanner: Used to capture user input.
  *java.util.ArrayList: Used to create and manage a dynamic list of grades.
